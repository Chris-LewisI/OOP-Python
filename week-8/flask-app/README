F L A S K:
    Flask is a web application framework that is used to easily make web applications. It is basically a backend for websites that is fully written in Python. It manages webpages, routing, requests, responses, and more all through a strictly typed Python format. The benefit of having it strictly typed is that since everything needs to be explicitly written it improves readability for the developer or anyone who may be reading the source code.
